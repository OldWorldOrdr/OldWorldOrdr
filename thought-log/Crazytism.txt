How much of my personality is getting suppressed by my meds?
A pill can't know the difference between personality and autism
Where does my personality end and autism begin?
Whats the difference between autism and a personality that resembles autism?
Is there a difference at all?
Will I always need to take meds to not act like an idiot?
Will there come a day where I am no longer burdened by this stupid fucking mental disorder?
I just want to be normal.
I just want to be able to talk with people without coming across like a crazy idiot.
I just want to be able to make friends.
It looks so easy, just be yourself.  But what about when the reason people don't like you is because they see "yourself" and they don't like it.
Am I just doomed to never be able to form relationships?
Will I have to fake a personality just to be accepted?
Why?
